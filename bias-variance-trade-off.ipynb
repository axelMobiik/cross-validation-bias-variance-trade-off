    "    The bias-variance trade-off is the point where we are adding just noise by adding model complexity (flexibility).\n",
    "    <br>The training error goes down as it has to, but the test error is starting to go up\n",
    "    <br>The model after the bias trade-off begins to overfit\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "    Imagine that the center of the target is a model that perfectly predicts the correct values.\n",
    "    <br>As we move away from the bulls-eye, our predictions get worse and worse.\n",
    "    <br>Imagine we can repeat our entire model building process to get a number of separate hits on the target.\n",
    "    <br>Each hit represents an individual realization of our model, given the chance variability in the training data we gather\n",
    "    <br>Sometimes we will get a good distribution of training data so we predict very well and we are close to the bulls-eye, while sometimes our training data might be full of outliers or non-standard values resulting in poorer predictions.\n",
    "    <br>These different realizations result in a scatter of hits on the target\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    A common temptation for beginners is to continually add complexity to a model until it fits the training set very well\n",
    "    <br>Doing this can cause a model to overfit to your training data and cause large errors on new data, such as the test set\n",
